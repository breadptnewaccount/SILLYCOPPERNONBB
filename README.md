# Silly Copper Development History

NOTE: i cancelled sc because of the shit what finlito and vadimos did to me (finlito and i made peace between us now)

# 2021-2022, the cmg version
It was purposed as cupcake monster and was supposed to be an fangame from brawl stars (ew) and sonic 
# 2023, probably the orange knight version
It got repurposed as an pt fangame and had sort of an gameplay feeling like CUBE: the game (yes, that is my game, don't complain about it)
# 2024, my version
I wanted it to remove the cupcake shit because the pt community hated him for leaking shit etc. (i am not gonna call all the details on this) and it was time for silly copper to shine
It was supposed to have an fast gameplay feeling
At first, it used the fox game engine (from gabergaming)
Second, the nbb recreation (from loypoll ðŸ¤®)
And as last, the (original) engine that vadimos made

# ENGINE SHIT

do what ever you want with it since i am working on CUBE: the game (as i said before)
